# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Cyber Puppet application with new branding, enhanced 3D model presentation, and revised gesture-to-action mappings with updated voice feedback and animations.

**Planned changes:**
- Change main heading to "Cyber Puppet" and add subheading "Project by 2nd AIML Students"
- Replace 3D robot model with a more interactive style featuring a rotating turntable/platform
- Update index finger gesture to speak "yay" and make model jump
- Update index + middle fingers gesture to speak "peace bro" and make model rotate
- Update index + middle + ring fingers gesture to speak "i love you" and make model raise both hands
- Update all five fingers gesture to speak "hi buddy" and make model wave right hand
- Update index + pinky fingers gesture to speak "yo yo" and make model move backward
- Update thumbs up gesture to speak "good job" and make model clap hands
- Update closed fist gesture to speak "come on fight" and make model move forward
- Update instructions modal to reflect all new gesture mappings

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see updated branding with the "Cyber Puppet" title, interact with a more engaging 3D model on a rotating platform, and trigger seven distinct gesture-action combinations with new voice feedback and model animations.
