  "summary": "The diff implements both requirements effectively. REQ-46 optimizations include faster animation speeds (delta * 8 for jump, delta * 15 for clap, delta * 12 for wave), reduced animation durations (0.6s for rotation, 0.5s for raise hands), increased lerp coefficients (0.3 to 0.35), and immediate gesture response through optimized useEffect logic. REQ-47 removes autonomous rotation by eliminating continuous rotation logic and making rotation gesture-triggered only for the peace gesture with explicit time-limited execution.",

      "description": "Added idle floating animation when no gesture is detected (Math.sin(state.clock.elapsedTime * 0.5) * 0.1)",
      "reason": "This behavior was not requested in the BuildRequest. The requirement states robot should 'remain stationary when no gesture is detected' (REQ-47 AC), but the implementation adds a subtle floating/bobbing motion during idle state.",
